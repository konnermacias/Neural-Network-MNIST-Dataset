# Neural-Network-MNIST-Dataset
Personal Project for Educational Purposes

Based off the book "Make Your Own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid, I completed this project to fully understand and implement a neural network.

This is a 3-layer neural network used to learn the database of handwritten digits(MNIST). The dataset was perfect for training a mini-image processing system.

The network predicted the correct digit compared against the test dataset with a performance score of 97.4%!

To get the training and testing data, the full dataset in CSV format is available at: http://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/
